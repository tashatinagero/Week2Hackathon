# Week2Hackathon
This was created as part of an educational hackathon project for Hack Reactor Remote Prep. This is a "fake" ecommerce website for our faux company "Sock Company!". We utilized Bootstrap & jQuery in edition to the basic javascript/html/css. 

Images are from the company Living Royal and can be purchased through their website :).
